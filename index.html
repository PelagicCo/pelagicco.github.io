        <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>
          At Pelagic, we envision a future where fish meat for human consumption is grown outside of whole fish, in a more sanitary and humane environment. We envision a future where our fish consumption doesn't have to ruin one of the Earth's most important ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pelagic zone is the largest aquatic habitat on Earth, and where 11% of known fish species live. The overfishing of this area is one of many causes of the collapse of ocean ecosystems. If we are to find a way to move forward sustainably with humanity's fish consumption, <strong>we need to find a replacement for the pelagic zone</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where we come in.
